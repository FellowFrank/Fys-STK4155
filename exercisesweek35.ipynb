    "This week you will be deriving the analytical expressions for linear regression, building up the model from scratch. This will include taking several derivatives of products of vectors and matrices. Such derivatives are central to the optimization of many machine learning models. Although we will often use automatic differentiation in actual calculations, to be able to have analytical expressions is extremely helpful in case we have simpler derivatives as well as when we analyze various properties (like second derivatives) of the chosen cost functions.\n",
