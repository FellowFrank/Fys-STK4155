## Description
To be delivered as a first project to the get a grade in the subject FYS-4155 at the University of Oslo autumn 2025. This is project 1 of 3, where the task in this project is to create a scientific report where the student goes through the different regression methods on Runge's function. Then looking into some resampling techniques on the OLS method.


### AI Usage
Since my favorite llm doesn't support any export of the chat except making a link and sharing the chatlog with the world, that is how it will be done.
So in the file ``AIChats.txt`` I will store the links to the and what the AI was used for in this chat.  

### Code
To run the codes used in this report, simply create a virtual environment and install the packages in ``requirements.txt`` with pip or an other package manager. 
For pip and using windows this would be the following:
```
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### ``Ex39.ipynb``
The code for answering exercises in week 39, not relevant for the project. Produces the two figures for this exercise `Bias_variance`* and `Ridge_heatmap`.

#### ``Utils.py``
A python library for functions defined in the project for easy of use.
